# Put all your resources under `resources:`. For each resource, you need:
# - The type of resource. In this example, the type is a Compute VM instance.
# - An internal name for the resource.
# - The properties for the resource. In this example, for VM instances, you add
#   the machine type, a boot disk, network information, and so on.
#
# For a list of supported resources,
# see https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/supported-resource-types.
